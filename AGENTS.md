# AGENTS.md — Kosy Project Guide for AI Agents

## Project Overview

Kosy is a **C++23 / Python** hybrid repository focused on **math problems** useful for interview preparation and exploration. The project uses **nanobind** for C++/Python interop, **doctest** for C++ tests, and **pytest** for Python tests. Code is licensed under the **MIT License**. Python bindings live alongside the C++/CUDA sources under `src/kosy/` and are built via **nanobind**, managed with **uv**.

## Build System

- **Primary**: **CMake** 3.31+ with **Ninja** as the primary generator (see `CMakePresets.json`).
- **Alternative**: **xmake** (see root `xmake.lua` and `xmake/`).
- **CPM** downloads and pins C++ dependencies; sources are cached under `third_party/` (see `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE`).
- **vcpkg** is used where appropriate for native dependencies (project-local tree).
- **CUDA**: both build systems compile `.cu` sources via **nvcc**, GPU architecture selection defaults to `native` (see `cmake/toolchains/*.cmake` and `xmake/toolchains/*.lua`).
- **Python**: **uv** with `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`. The `_core` nanobind extension is built via CMake (or xmake) using the Python interpreter in `.venv/`; `uv sync --no-install-project` provisions that venv without triggering the (slow, full-C++-dependency-tree) scikit-build-core wheel build. `pyproject.toml` uses **scikit-build-core**/CMake as the build backend by default; `pyproject.xmake.toml` is an alternate config using the **xmake-python** backend instead (swap in with `cp pyproject.xmake.toml pyproject.toml`), see `.claude/rules/08-python-conventions.md`.

## Languages & Toolchains

| Language   | Version / notes                                        | Primary layout                     |

## Code Formatting

Formatting is **mandatory** after substantive edits:

- **C++**: `clang-format` 22+ using the repository **Microsoft** base style (see `.clang-format`).
- **Python**: **ruff** (formatter + linter), aligned with `pyproject.toml`.

Run formatters on touched files before considering work complete.

## Repository Structure

## Development Workflow

1. **Implement** functionality in the appropriate module under `src/kosy/` (C++/CUDA sources and Python bindings live together).
2. Add or update tests: **doctest** for `*_test.cpp`, **pytest** for Python (under `tests/kosy/`).
3. Configure and build C++ tests / nanobind extension via CMake: `cmake --preset <preset>` then `cmake --build out/build/<preset>`.
4. **Install the Python package** so `from kosy import ...` resolves the nanobind extension. `uv sync` handles this automatically (since `[tool.uv] package = true`):
   ```bash
   uv sync   # installs dependencies + builds _core.so via scikit-build-core
   ```
5. Run tests: `ctest --test-dir out/build/<preset>` and/or `uv run pytest`.
6. **Format**: `clang-format -i` on C++ changes; `ruff format` / `ruff check --fix` on Python.
7. **Lint**: `clang-tidy` on C++ where configured; `ruff` + **pyright** for Python.
8. Fix warnings; treat compiler warnings as errors where the project enables that.

## Copyright Header

C++ headers and sources use a **Doxygen** file header, for example:

```cpp
/**
 * @file example.cpp
 * @author Author Name (author@example.com)
 * @brief Short description.
 * @version 0.1
 * @date YYYY-MM-DD
 *
 * @copyright Copyright (c) 2026 Kosy Development Team
 *            All rights reserved.
 *
 */
```

Python modules use:

```python
# Copyright (c) 2026 Kosy Development Team. All rights reserved.
```

Use the **current year** for new files. CMake scripts do not use this header.

## TODO Format

```
// TODO(github_id): description [optional issue reference]
```

Use `#` instead of `//` in Python. Always include your GitHub ID in parentheses.

## File Creation Policy

- Do **not** add demos, samples, or unsolicited documentation files unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer extending existing modules and tests.
- Add C++ dependencies via **CPM** / CMake in `cmake/third_party` (or as established in-repo).
- Add Python dependencies in `pyproject.toml` and refresh the lockfile with **uv** as appropriate.
- Keep experimental or personal scratch work out of production paths unless the repo defines a dedicated area.

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
